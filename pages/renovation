            <p style="margin-top:10px;"><strong>September 18, 2014, Edmonton, AB…</strong>Londonderry Mall announced today it has officially embarked on a $130 million renovation and re-merchandising project that will dramatically enhance the shopping experience by providing new retail and dining options and reinforcing the property as Northeast Edmonton’s one-stop shopping destination.</p>
            <p>Project highlights include:</p>
            <ul class="renovation-list">
                <li>Full renovation of all mall common areas including mall entrances, flooring, storefronts, escalators and elevators, washrooms, ceilings and seating areas;</li>
                <li>The addition of exciting new retailers, renovations within existing retailer spaces and new full-service dining experiences;</li>
                <li>Relocation of the food court from its current location to the west side of the building providing additional seating and a dedicated exterior entrance.  The contemporary space will emulate an interior terrace and will feature an abundance of natural light;</li>
                <li>Lighting replacement program upgrading all interior and exterior fixtures to energy efficient LED.  The lighting program includes the undercover parking garage, roof top parking and the open parking lot as well as all interior lights to create uniform lighting throughout;</li>
                <li>A new state-of-the-art security surveillance system to provide high definition coverage of both interior and exterior common areas of the centre.</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="margin-top:15px;">The new Londonderry, designed in partnership by MMC Architects and GH+A Design, will incorporate an elevated design aesthetic coupled with enhanced functionality.  The sense of arrival will be expressed with bold architectural entrances, well-defined drop-off and pick-up areas as well as easily accessible parking options.  Once inside, grand volumes will greet visitors into the contemporary common areas featuring sleek information kiosks and social gathering spaces.</p>
            <p>“Northeast Edmonton is experiencing unprecedented growth and the completion of the Anthony Henday Drive ring road in 2016 will open up access to our property to an even larger market who currently have to travel a substantial distance to satisfy their shopping needs,” said Greg Orysiuk, Vice President of Leasing, 20 VIC Management Inc. “We’re confident the improvements and new stores we’re bringing to the community will change the face of retail in Northeast Edmonton and enhance the shopping experience for both existing clientele and the new markets opening up to us,” he said.</p>
            <p>Work is now underway and minimal business disruption is anticipated throughout the project. Further information on the project and specific retailer announcements will be shared over the coming months.</p>
